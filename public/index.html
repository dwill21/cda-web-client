At CDA, we believe that companies win or lose new business based primarily on their competitiveness in the markets they pursue. To do this, we have a highly experienced group of quantitative data analysts who focus on the other extreme of the &quot;big data&quot; problem: what do you do when the available data is very limited, uncertain and even contradictory? We do this through our Black Hat, Price-To-Win, and Win Loss Analysis Products.">
