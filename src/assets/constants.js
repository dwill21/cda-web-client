    blackHat: 'We collect open source competitive intelligence on desired '
      + 'competitors, then present it to and facilitate a client-participant CDA Black Hat. Our process and model '
      + 'produce 1) predicted competition outcome and 2) alternative win strategies that increase probability of '
      + 'win. There isn\'t just one "best" win strategy. Let CDA help you determine what your alternatives are '
      + 'and make an informed decision on which one is best for you.',
    priceToWin: 'We collect open source competitive intelligence data to populate our predictive '
      + 'models to provide a client most-likely competitor bid prices, best value scores, and Probability of Win. '
      + 'We also provide bid aggressiveness targets for client bid decision-maker consideration. Let CDA\'s '
      + 'high-accuracy data analysis help you determine what you can do to push a close loss to a win.',
    forensicAnalysis: 'We analyze wins and losses through our objective framework to '
      + 'determine how and why your company won or lost a pursuit. This aids a client in determining what has '
      + 'worked and what has not, free from the natural, inherent bias of solely using internal company '
      + 'personnel. You paid for that win/loss debrief; let CDA help you decipher the objective business '
      + 'lessons it can teach.',
    strategicPlanning: 'CDA personnel have that rare business development skill set of realistic strategic '
      + 'planning, transitioned into action, constrained by resource limits, producing predictable results. '
      + 'We help companies create or improve upon their Pipeline builds, opportunity qualifications, capture '
      + 'planning, and resource loading. We do this better than anyone else because we understand the underlying '
      + 'uncertainties and how to plan/overcome them. Do you find yourself running out of Business Development '
      + 'budget before the year is over? No idea how many proposals you need to write in order to make your '
      + 'bookings and revenue goals? Wish you had a realistic plan that you could actually manage to? Now '
      + 'might be the time to talk to CDA\'s Strategic Planning team to help you put in place a better framework '
      + 'for making your aspirational growth goals a reality.',
    tacticalSupport: 'Need help with a soon-to-be proposal? Decades of both Government and Industry '
      + 'experience, armed with data analysis of hundreds of award decisions, has taught us what it actually '
      + 'takes to win Government business, as opposed to the many myths of how it\'s done. CDA has experienced '
      + 'capture managers and pricers that can help you craft a winning solution and a winning proposal, based '
      + 'on the intersection of what your company can reasonably execute, what Government evaluators judge is '
      + 'realistic, and what is likely to beat your competitors. We can provide everything from a few hours of '
      + 'of consultative help on an immediate problem facing a capture team to providing Past Performance, '
      + 'Cost, and Management volume authors/leads. Your company is spending a lot of money to submit a proposal; '
      + 'let CDA help you give it the best chance of success.',
